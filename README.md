# send-text-message
From a Raspberry Pi, send an email to gmail using ssmtp, and then forward the email to one or more smart phones as a text message.

This is used where a Raspberry Pi should send an alert of a condition thta needs immediate attention.

A gmail filter looks for an ID when it arrivesw, and then forwards that email to one or more cellphones.

Sending alerts is usually part of a larger project.
